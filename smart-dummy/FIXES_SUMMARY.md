# Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Dockerfile.dev - Syntax Error (Line 24)**
**Issue:** Extra space in npm command
```bash
# BEFORE: CMD ["npm", " start:dev"]
# AFTER:  CMD ["npm", "run", "start:dev"]
```
**Fix:** Corrected the command syntax in Dockerfile.dev

---

### 2. **Database Host Mismatch in .env.development**
**Issue:** Database host didn't match the docker-compose service name
```
# BEFORE: DB_HOST=dummy-postgres-dev (service doesn't exist)
# AFTER:  DB_HOST=postgres (matches docker-compose service name)
```
**Fix:** Updated `.env.development` to use correct service name

---

### 3. **External Network Requirement**
**Issue:** docker-compose files required an external network `ololo-network` that didn't exist
```yaml
# BEFORE:
networks:
  ololo-network:
    external: true  # ‚ùå Would fail if network doesn't exist

# AFTER:
networks:
  gates-network:
    driver: bridge  # ‚úÖ Creates the network automatically
```
**Fix:**
- Updated `docker-compose.dev.yml` to create its own network
- Updated `docker-compose.prod.yml` to create its own network
- Both services now use the `gates-network` they create

---

### 4. **No Automatic DB Generation & Seeding**
**Issue:** After container starts, manual steps were required:
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

**Fix:** Created automatic entrypoint scripts:

#### `entrypoint.sh` (Development)
- Waits for database to be ready (5s)
- Runs `db:generate`
- Runs `db:migrate`
- Runs `db:seed`
- Starts the app with `npm run start:dev`

#### `entrypoint.prod.sh` (Production)
- Waits for database to be ready (10s)
- Runs `db:generate`
- Runs `db:migrate`
- Runs `db:seed`
- Starts the app with `node dist/src/main.js`

---

## Files Modified

### 1. [Dockerfile.dev](Dockerfile.dev)
- Fixed npm command syntax
- Added bash installation for entrypoint script
- Changed from `CMD` to `ENTRYPOINT` to use the setup script
- Added entrypoint.sh copy and execution permissions

### 2. [Dockerfile.prod](Dockerfile.prod)
- Added bash installation
- Changed to multi-stage build with entrypoint
- Copy entrypoint.prod.sh and src directory
- Changed from `CMD` to `ENTRYPOINT` to use the setup script

### 3. [.env.development](.env.development)
- Changed `DB_HOST=dummy-postgres-dev` to `DB_HOST=postgres`

### 4. [docker-compose.dev.yml](docker-compose.dev.yml)
- Removed external network dependency
- Created local `gates-network` bridge
- Removed `command: npm run start:dev` (now handled by entrypoint)
- Added network configuration to both services

### 5. [docker-compose.prod.yml](docker-compose.prod.yml)
- Added network configuration to both services
- Created local `gates-network` bridge

### 6. **New Files Created**
- [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) - Development startup script
- [entrypoint.prod.sh](entrypoint.prod.sh) - Production startup script

## How It Works Now

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run docker:dev:build
# or
npm run docker:dev
```

The container will:
1. Build the application
2. Start both database and API containers
3. Wait for database to be healthy
4. Automatically run `db:generate`
5. Automatically run `db:migrate`
6. Automatically run `db:seed`
7. Start the development server with hot reload

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run docker:prod:build
# or
npm run docker:prod
```

The container will:
1. Build the application in multi-stage build
2. Start both database and API containers
3. Wait for database to be healthy
4. Automatically run `db:generate`
5. Automatically run `db:migrate`
6. Automatically run `db:seed`
7. Start the production application

---

## Verification

After container startup, you should see logs like:
```
=========================================
  [Development|Production] Startup Script
=========================================
‚è≥ Waiting for database connection...
üìã Generating database schema...
üîÑ Running database migrations...
üå± Seeding database...
=========================================
‚úÖ Database setup completed!
=========================================
üöÄ Starting [dev|production] application...
```

Then your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## No More Manual Steps Required!

‚úÖ No need to manually run `db:generate`
‚úÖ No need to manually run `db:migrate`
‚úÖ No need to manually run `db:seed`

Everything happens automatically after successful container startup.
